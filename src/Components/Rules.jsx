            violation by any member/members of the Rules and Regulations and/or
            Bye-Laws of the Association. If it is considered that such violation
            is grave and is required to be seriously dealt with or should any
            situation arise which tends to prejudicially affect the interest,
            character or endanger the stability of the Society, it shall be the
            duty of the Executive Committee to convene a General Meeting
            comprising the members of the Core Committee and the Treasury
            Committee, where at 2/3rd majority of the members present shall
            decide the issue of expulsion of the member/members concerned.
            Thereafter, if the General Meeting so decides, such member(s) shall
            cease to belong to the Society. The question relating to a member’s
            conduct may not be considered if he/she prefers to resign rather
            than have his conduct discussed unless of course there is any
            financial involvement which in the opinion of the Executive
            Committee deserves to be appropriately dealt with. Such expelled
            member will not be allowed to rejoin the Society in any capacity, at
            any point in the future.

            longer time as permitted by the Executive Committee.
          </li>
          <li>
            Upon the member being found guilty of moral turpitude by a competent
            Court of Law.

          <li>Upon a member being adjudged insolvent or of unsound mind.</li>
          <li>Upon death.</li>
          <li>Upon his written resignation to the Secretary.</li>
          <li>
            A member may be suspended from exercising his/her voting rights in
            the Society by the vote of not less than 2/3rd of the members
            present and voting at an Executive Committee meeting of the Society
            (which shall be final and conclusive) on a motion that in the
            opinion of the Executive Committee the member has:

                unsound mind.

              <li>
                Acted in the premises or forums associated with the Society in a
                disgraceful manner or in a manner which has caused serious
                offence on his fellow members.
